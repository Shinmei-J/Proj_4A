# Presentation:
This is my version of the mobile project that have been given to us.
At the beginning, we had to follow the videos given by the teacher to create a login page, to have a clean MVVM Architecture and a database that we can use later on for further improvments.
Things that I did, I created an app where you can create a user and when you log in, you have a list of all the characters of Genshin Impact.


# Given instructions :

* Login Screen/Account creation
* MVVM
* Clean Architecture
* DB Room
* Design
* Activity where we display a list of API calls


# Introducing the App:

## First screen:

- This is the first screen, where you have to login in order to have access of what's inside

- But when you haven't yet signed up this error message pops up

So you have to click on create account

## Sign up page:
- This is the create account, the login button is not here anymore and there will be errors if the user is not an email / the email already exists or no email/password is typed in.
